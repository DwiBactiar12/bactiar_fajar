I am a Fresh Graduate who is passionate about web development projects, both back-end and front-end also already
know about basic programming. Previously, I have made several web applications including e-commerce and event
ticket sales. But, I feel more comfortable working as a Backend Engineer. I learned a lot of things about Backend
Engineering at Alterra Academy, and now I am able to create Restful API, work with third-party API, deploy the
application with CI/CD and handle deployment on AWS.
